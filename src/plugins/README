This is a catalog of Dist::Zilla plugins.  To add a plugin to the
catalog, add it to the appropriate plugin-author.pod file (creating a
new one if necessary) and then submit a pull request on GitHub.

Please use one file per author; this should help avoid merge conflicts.


Extended POD syntax:

  =author CPANID

      This sets the author for all following plugins
      (until the next =author, but there should only be 1 per POD file)

  =plugin PluginName
  tagname tagname...

  Plugin description paragraph.

      This defines a plugin.  Please keep the description short, no
      more than 1 or 2 brief paragraphs.

  =tag tagname

  Tag description paragraph.

      This defines a tag and gives it a description.
