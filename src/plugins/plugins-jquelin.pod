=plugin AutoPrereqs
core prereqs

This plugin will attempt to determine your distribution's
prerequisites automatically by scanning your files using
L<Perl::PrereqScanner>.


=plugin Git::Check
before-release git version-control

This plugin ensures that Git is in a clean state before releasing.
This means you have no no untracked files or uncommitted changes in
the working copy (execpt those you intend to commit as part of the
release process).


=plugin Git::Commit
after-release git version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will record this fact in Git by
committing the changelog and F<dist.ini>.


=plugin Git::CommitBuild
after-release git version-control

Once the build is done, this plugin will commit the results of the
build to a branch that is completely separate from your regular code
branches (i.e. with a different root commit).  This potentially makes
your repository more useful to those who may not have L<Dist::Zilla>
and all of its dependencies installed.


=plugin Git::GatherDir
file-gatherer git version-control

This subclass of the L<GatherDir|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir>
plugin gathers only the files that are tracked by Git (as determined
by S<C<git ls-files>>).  This can keep you from needing to maintain
separate F<.gitignore> and F<MANIFEST.SKIP> files.


=plugin Git::Init
minting git version-control

This plugin initializes a Git repository when a new distribution is
created with S<C<dzil new>>.


=plugin Git::NextVersion
git version-control version-provider

This provides a version number by finding the last version number from
your Git tags and incrementing it using L<Version::Next>.


=plugin Git::Push
after-release git version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will push the current Git branch
and tags to your configured remote.


=plugin Git::Tag
after-release before-release git version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will record this fact in Git by
creating a tag.  It also checks before a release to ensure that tag
doesn't already exist (which would indicate you're trying to release
the same version twice).
