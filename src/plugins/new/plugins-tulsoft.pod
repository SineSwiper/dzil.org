=plugin CheckEmacsChangeLog
changelog

It is a simple extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangeLog> allowing
to check that a sentence about a new version was added to a file
C<ChangeLog> in your project. It differs from the
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangeLog> by expecting the format of the
C<ChangeLog> file being the one used by the Emacs's ChangeLog mode. Which
means, for example, this one:

=plugin Pod2Html
documentation install

This plugin generates HTML pages from the POD files and puts them into the
distribution in a separate directory (not as a tree of files but flatten).
The created HTML pages have the same (or, at least, similar) style as the
modules' documentation shown at CPAN.
