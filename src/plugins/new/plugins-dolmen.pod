=plugin ReportVersions::Tiny
file-gatherer template

This module integrates with L<Dist::Zilla> to automatically add an
additional test to your released software. Rather than testing features of
the software, this reports the versions of all static module dependencies,
and of Perl, at the time the tests are run.

=plugin Version::FromSubversion
template version version-control version-provider

B<Using revision numbers of the versioning system is a *really bad* idea:
that will not scale>. For example, it will not work if you start to use
branches and want to make releases from them because revision numbers are
global, and not per branch. So keep this only for small projects and be
prepared to change you version scheme if that goes wrong!
