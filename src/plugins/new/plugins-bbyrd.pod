=plugin @Prereqs
bundle

This is a handy L<Dist::Zilla> plugin bundle that ties together several
useful Prereq plugins:

=plugin MinimumPrereqs
prereqs

This plugin will scan for any "blank" pre-requirement (ie: C<<< Module => 0
>>>), search MetaCPAN for the lowest version that was released at least
within C<<< minimum_year >>>, and fix the prereq to contain that mimimum
version.

=plugin PrereqsClean
prereqs

Ever notice that it's really easy to figure out if a module's author used
Dist::Zilla by the amount of dependencies? strict? warnings? base? Every
module for Foo::Bar::*, individually listed?
