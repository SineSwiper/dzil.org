The following is a list of plugins in this distribution to help you
integrate L<Catalyst> and L<Dist::Zilla>

=plugin Catalyst::New

This plugin is used to generate the same files L<Catalyst::Helper> does
when C<catalyst.pl App::Name> is run.

=plugin PodSpellingTests
documentation tests

(DEPRECATED) The old name of the PodSpelling plugin

=plugin SubmittingPatches
template

Add a patch submission policy to your repository similar to that of
git.git. In the long run I'm hoping to be able to generate slightly
different policies with this module. Complaints, or suggestions about the
actual policy are welcome

=plugin Test::EOL
template tests

Generate an author L<Test::EOL>.

=plugin Test::PodSpelling
documentation template tests

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing the
following file:

=plugin Test::Version

This module will add a L<Test::Version> test as a release test to your
module.
