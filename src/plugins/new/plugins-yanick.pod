=plugin ChangeStats::Git
file-munger git version-control

Adds a line to the changelog giving some stats about the code churn since
the last release, which will look like:

=plugin CoalescePod
documentation file-munger

If the files I<Foo.pm> and I<Foo.pod> both exist, the content of the pod
file is appended at the end of the C<.pm>, and the pod file is removed.

=plugin Covenant
install template

C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Covenant> adds the file 'I<AUTHOR_PLEDGE>' to the
distribution. The author as defined in I<dist.ini> is taken as being the
pledgee.

=plugin HelpWanted
install

C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::HelpWanted> adds an C<x_help_wanted> field in the
META information of the distribution.

=plugin NextVersion::Semantic
after-release file-munger template version version-provider

Increases the distribution's version according to the semantic versioning
rules (see L<http://semver.org/>) by inspecting the changelog. 

=plugin PreviousVersion::Changelog
changelog version

Plugin implementing the L<Dist::Zilla::Role::PreviousVersionProvider> role.
It provides the previous released version by peeking at the C<Changelog>
file and returning its latest release, skipping over C<{{$NEXT}}> if its
there (see L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NextRelease>).

=plugin SchwartzRatio
after-release

The Schwartz Ratio of CPAN is the number of number of latest releases over
the total number of releases that CPAN has. For a single distribution, it
boils down to the less exciting number of previous releases still on CPAN.
