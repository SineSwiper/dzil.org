=plugin CheckVersionIncrement
before-release version

This plugin prevents your from releasing a distribution unless it has a
version number I<greater> than the latest version already indexed on CPAN.

=plugin CopyFilesFromBuild

from the build directory into the distribution directoory. This is so you
can commit them to version control.

=plugin ReadmeAnyFromPod
documentation file-pruner install

Generates a README for your L<Dist::Zilla> powered dist from its
C<main_module> in any of several formats. The generated README can be
included in the build or created in the root of your dist for e.g.
inclusion into version control.

=plugin ReadmeMarkdownFromPod
documentation

Generate a README.mkdn from C<main_module> by L<Pod::Markdown>

=plugin StaticVersion
version version-provider

This purpose of this plugin is to allow plugin bundles or other such things
to specify a specific version number. This allows one to write a
pluginbundle that decides based on its configuration whether to offer a
specific version number. You could not otherwise do this, because a static
version number is specified before any plugins in F<dist.ini>.
