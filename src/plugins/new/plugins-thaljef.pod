=plugin >cook
command

This L<Dist::Zilla> command "cooks" your distribution from scratch. It
builds, tests, and installs, your distribution and all of its dependencies
in a sandbox using L<cpanm> and L<local::lib>. The dependencies are pulled
from the local L<Pinto> repository in the f<pan> directory, and the
resulting build is placed in the F<dlib> directory.

=plugin >scrub
command

This L<Dist::Zilla> command "scrubs" your work space to a clean state by
removing any dependencies that have been installed F<dlib> directory, thus
forcing the next cooking to be done from scratch.

=plugin >stock
command

This L<Dist::Zilla> command "stocks" the "pantry" with all the ingredients
for your distribution. More specifically, the C<stock> command extracts the
dependencies from your distribution and uses L<Pinto> to import all of them
into a local CPAN-like repository in the F<pan> directory. As your
distribution evolves and accumulates more dependencies, you can run the
C<stock> command again to "stock" the additional ingredients.

=plugin Pinto::Add
releaser

C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Pinto::Add> is a release-stage plugin that will add
your distribution to a local or remote L<Pinto> repository.
