=plugin CheckExtraTests
before-release tests tests-extra

This plugin ensures that the tests in the F<xt/> directory pass before
allowing a release.  It is a complement to the C<xtest> command and an
alternative to the L<ExtraTests|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExtraTests> and
L<RunExtraTests|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RunExtraTests> plugins.  (You
should probably use RunExtraTests instead.)


=plugin RunExtraTests
tests tests-extra

This plugin runs the tests in the F<xt/> directory when you do
S<C<dzil test>> or use the
L<TestRelease|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TestRelease> plugin.  It's more
efficient than L<CheckExtraTests|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests>
because it integrates more tightly with MakeMaker (and ModuleBuild),
allowing dzil to build the dist once and then run both the normal
tests and the extra tests.
