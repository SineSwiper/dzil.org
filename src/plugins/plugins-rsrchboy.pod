=plugin Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch
before-release git version-control

This plugin checks that you are on the correct branch before allowing
a release.  It prevents accidental releases being cut from topic
branches.


=plugin Git::CheckFor::Fixups
before-release git version-control

This plugin checks that you have no fixup or squash commits remaining
in your history since the last release.  The presence of these commits
is almost certainly an oversight, so if any are found the release is
aborted.
