This selects files by matching their pathnames.


=plugin FileFinder::Filter
core file-finder

This takes the results from another FileFinder and filters out
unwanted files by matching their pathnames.


=plugin TestRelease
core tests before-release

This plugin extracts the tarball that's about to be released and
ensures that it passes its tests.  If any tests fail it aborts the
release.  B<You should be using this plugin.> (It's included in
L<@Basic|Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Basic>.)


=plugin VersionFromModule
version version-provider

This extracts the version number from the main module, just like
L<MakeMaker|ExtUtils::MakeMaker> does with C<VERSION_FROM> or
L<Module::Build> does with C<dist_version_from>.  Useful if you want to
manually manage your distribution's version.
